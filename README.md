# Whitehats-Intro
Name: Divyansh Ranka  
I want to join WhiteHats because I am interested in cybersecurity and want to learn real skills. I want to understand how attacks happen and how to protect systems.  
Recent News: I read about data breaches where cloud databases were left open and user data got exposed.
